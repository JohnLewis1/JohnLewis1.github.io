If your motion sensing unit is set off, you get a notice in your smartphone app. There's no latency so you get notified right away so you can take instant actions such as activating a loud alarm, calling the authorities, or utilizing the camera's two-way audio system to talk with the prospective burglars.</p>

<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
