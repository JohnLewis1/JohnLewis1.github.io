<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
