<p>B.

<p>An engaging argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe subscription is that it adds individual detection, which makes for smarter smartphone alerts-- and, in some cases, fewer false informs.

During our hands-on testing of Brinks, we found the systems to be rather simple to set up and utilize-- but not quite as simple as brand names like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm.</p>
