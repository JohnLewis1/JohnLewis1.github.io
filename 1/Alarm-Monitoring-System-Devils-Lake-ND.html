However, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute considerably to authorities capability to collar burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by authorities and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize police action to alarmed properties) a costly and ineffective  method to robbery reduction throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
