<p>Since it's more complicated than it needs to be, we don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.
