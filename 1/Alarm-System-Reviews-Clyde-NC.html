<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
