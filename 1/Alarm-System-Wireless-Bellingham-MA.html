<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
