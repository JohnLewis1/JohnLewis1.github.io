However, they are still subject to interference and they are still susceptible to being hacked even if the signal is encrypted.</p>
<p>Analog high definition cameras are a fantastic alternative for businesses to upgrade from analog CCTV that has actually already been wired utilizing coax cable or CAT-5 cable television.

Looks like a safer bet to us.</p>
