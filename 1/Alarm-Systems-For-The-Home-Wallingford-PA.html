<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the very same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider area and therefore uses less pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image across a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
