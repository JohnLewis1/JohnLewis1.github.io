If the system was not installed during the homebuilding procedure, setting one up might need drilling holes into walls, running new wires, covering drywall and gaining access to challenging areas that are sealed off in basements or attics. Wired security systems are likewise vulnerable to power blackouts. Most will have a backup battery system that switches on in case of an outage, but long term blackouts will lead to the system losing power.
