<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also good metal construction.

Should be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
