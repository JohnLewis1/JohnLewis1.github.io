These companies designed their equipment in this manner to make clients stick with them longer, since switching monitoring companies suggests numerous dollars down the drain and a big headache for customers. How did they do it? They put five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their latest software application and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't state which device was the very first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
