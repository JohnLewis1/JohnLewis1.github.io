As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
