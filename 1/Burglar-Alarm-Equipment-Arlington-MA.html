However, remember that the monitoring company's reaction time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

<p>The real factor cameras are generally released is to minimize much pettier crimes. But it has actually not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have actually been thoroughly deployed in public locations, sociologists studying the issue have found that they have not reduced criminal offense. "Once the criminal activity and offense figures were adjusted to take account of the basic downward trend in criminal activities and offenses," criminologists found in one research study, "decreases were kept in mind in particular categories however there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had decreased crime in general in the city centre."
