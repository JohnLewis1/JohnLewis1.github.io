<p>Some wireless home security systems use a video recording storage option and others do not. For the ones that do not, you are able to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is recorded. The systems with video storage generally consist of either a local storage or cloud storage option. A local storage alternative conserves a pre-determined number of video clips on the gadget itself. This alternative is normally cost-free. A cloud storage choice conserves your video in the cloud.

<p>We love the convenience and flexibility of wireless home security cameras. Among our favorites, the Arlo Pro 3, is 100% wire-free.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
