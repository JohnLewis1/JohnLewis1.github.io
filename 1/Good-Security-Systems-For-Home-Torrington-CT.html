<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the exact very same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electric present. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical present to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
