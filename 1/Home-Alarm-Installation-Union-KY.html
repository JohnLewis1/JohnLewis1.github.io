<p>Discover how to create, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and decrease crime. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our testing, nevertheless, we discovered the motion sensor to be sensitive, with awful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot.
