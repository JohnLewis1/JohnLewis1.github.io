<p>A wired security system was the first type of security system that was created for property owners. It must be installed by a professional alarm installation group and, as soon as installed, is hard to move from one place to another.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically referred to as shock sensors, are different because they are installed on the glass pane.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
