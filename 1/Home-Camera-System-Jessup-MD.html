<p>Twenty-five years ago, basic and business interactions were mainly synchronous. To achieve practically anything, someone live" needed to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, specifically when handling worldwide and national business. The very same is true for security and video surveillance. Generally, CCTV is most effective as an active system, with a security guard monitoring the corridors and someone else, somewhere, watching video surveillance screens for assistance. Everything is synchronized and everything happens in real time.</p>
<p>Many contemporary CCTV video surveillance systems incorporate DVRs (digital video recorders) which make it possible for operators to gain a few of the advantages of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs transform the analog footage to digital, which helps to extend storage capability, makes it a lot easier to search archived footage, and likewise permits users to stream video over a network for remote viewing from numerous locations.

But keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or damaged by the more determined intruders. If burglars can not see any security cameras, they may likewise be less cautious about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>
