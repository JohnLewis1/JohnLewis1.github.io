<p>Discover how to create, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and minimize crime. The Ring Floodlight Camera integrates 2 vital gadgets in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera finds movement, it turns on its two powerful LED beams as well as its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording.

Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to send the WiFi information. (You need to play this at full volume or it will not work).

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on produced to attend to the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked.

The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
