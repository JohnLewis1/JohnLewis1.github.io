We love that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only alerts you when motion is created by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (guaranteeing there's no incorrect alerts). However, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have key fobs and extra sensing units, too.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
