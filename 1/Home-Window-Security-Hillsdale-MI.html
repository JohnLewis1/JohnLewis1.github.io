<p>DITEK's burglar alarm surge protectors guard your security system versus transient surges that can enter through AC power lines, telephone lines and remote alert zones.

Smart locks, programmable thermostats, cameras, and other automated home gadgets are by their very nature wireless, and a lot of home security companies use a home automation plan with an app to remotely control everything on the system.
