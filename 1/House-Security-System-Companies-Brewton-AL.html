<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise good metal building.

Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
