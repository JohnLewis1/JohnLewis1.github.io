<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a harmful enemy, given that the disruption of the network prevents the flow of information and in fact indirectly protects information by preventing it from being sent. The usual factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering an opportunity for the harmful assaulter to tape these codes and utilize various cracking tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can launch a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based on the "model" security key captured during the network recovery.</p>
