<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, theft, and fraud. Tip: Often keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to once again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one method of getting rid of expensive incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it instantly switch off the heater. If the motion sensors are activated, you can automatically make the clever lights turn on to scare away possible robbers.</p>
<p>Outdoor Camera - This weatherproof camera provides smooth security video with a mix of tough circuitry and WiFi. It's motion-activated and has a speaker system, letting you send voice cautions through your phone. The lens covers 140 degrees and lets you focus on the action. Like the Ping camera, the Vivint Outdoor Camera records 20-second clips. After we used the Anker EufyCam for nearly 6 months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to deliver on its pledge of approximately one year of battery life. What we don't love is that it leaves spaces in between recordings, which ranged anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending upon the settings. We have seen some improvements since the camera's launch, and will continue to check and upgrade this review, as needed.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
