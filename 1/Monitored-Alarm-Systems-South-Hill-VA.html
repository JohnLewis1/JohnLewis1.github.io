<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, uncertainty has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated contracts with long-lasting lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often leading to incorrect alarms. ELERTS is a free smartphone app that permits citizens who see something suspicious to take a picture and quickly send it to public safety officials. For example, a public transit rider may discover someone acting suspiciously. Lots of people are messing, surfing or texting with their mobile devices.

Reports from smart phone users can be rapidly evaluated and acted on by Public Safety authorities.</p>
<p>No false alarm penalties: Homeowners with a self-monitored system are less most likely to dispatch the authorities for a false alarm. Since the house owner supervises of the system, cops are just gotten in touch with if there's a real emergency situation. On the other hand, a professional monitoring company will get in touch with cops if a homeowner can't verify a false alarm. If  authorities are contacted for an incorrect alarm, house owners might need to pay a fine for dispatching cops unnecessarily. A self-monitored home limitations the potential for false alarms and subsequent penalties.</p>
