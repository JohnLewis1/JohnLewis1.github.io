<p>There are 2 primary kinds of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: internet procedure (IP) cameras and the conventional analog cameras. IP cameras are the more contemporary iteration of analog cameras, and while the private cameras tend to be a little more expensive, they provide a number of functions that analog cameras do not. Here's a look at the differences between the two kinds of camera. Today's wireless home security systems are more stable than they used to be. Nevertheless, they are still based on interference and they are still vulnerable to being hacked even if the signal is secured.</p>
