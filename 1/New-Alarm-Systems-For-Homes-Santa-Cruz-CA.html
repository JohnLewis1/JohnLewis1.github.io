<p>There need to be a clear view between wireless transceivers, so that each camera can see" the home structure to transmit video. We tried each of the cameras in numerous areas around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we checked each camera utilizing an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) along with an Android mobile phone (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie).

Also a local alarm won't contact the authorities; it simply sets off an audible siren to alert people close by.</p>
