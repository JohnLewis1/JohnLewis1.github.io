<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security plan, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to carry a share of the cost. If alarm use led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less robberies across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent.
