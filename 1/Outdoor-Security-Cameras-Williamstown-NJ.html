Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I checked, consisting of clever things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. But the Secure is pricey, extra sensing units are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also expensive if you do not commit to a three-year contract.</p>
<p>It would be simple to roll your eyes at this last point, but it suggests you can ask your home security camera for the weather report - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the unit will reply.
