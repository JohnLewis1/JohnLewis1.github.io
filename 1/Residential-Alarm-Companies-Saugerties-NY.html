<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later created to deal with the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Utilizing an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly selected words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
