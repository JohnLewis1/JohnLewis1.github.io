<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we checked, and it provides two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our testing. The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces.
