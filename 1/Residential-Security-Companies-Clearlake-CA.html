<p>Home security systems and modern wise home abilities and compatibilities permit you to use their sensors and cameras straight from your phone. Look for a model that uses a high resolution (1080p), a large angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision range up to 25 feet, and affordable cloud storage for recorded video.
