Which rate jumps a lot when you add clever cameras to any Blue system. We like that you can select from indoor, outdoor, and doorbell cameras, but every smart camera Blue offers is $200.</p>
<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we checked, and it offers two-way interaction with its paid Canary Subscription. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our testing. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces.

<p>Because it's more complex than it should be, we don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>We did a quarterly evaluation of our Best Home Security Systems rankings and some newbies shook things up. We added Do It Yourself newcomer Blue by ADT. And in response to consumer interest and need, we moved Google Nest Secure into our top five.
