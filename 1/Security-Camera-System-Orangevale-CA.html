Commercial-grade cameras are designed and built for high-performance applications where failure is not an alternative; consumer-grade cameras are not.

Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control panel and keypads, different sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.
