<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise great metal building.
