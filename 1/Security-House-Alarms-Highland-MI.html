<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed appearances and face acknowledgment software application. The latter allows you to see specifically when a specific person comes to your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time.
