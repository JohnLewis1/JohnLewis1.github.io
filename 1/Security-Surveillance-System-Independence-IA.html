<p>Among IP security alternatives, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send out information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A common mistaken belief is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then connects to a router and the web.
