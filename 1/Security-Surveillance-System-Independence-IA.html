<p>Among IP security alternatives, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send out information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A common mistaken belief is that wireless implies the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still require a power cable. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then connects to a router and the web. Finally, wire-free cameras are completely cable complimentary and battery powered. Although battery replacements are needed, these are the easiest choice to install and all of the taped video footage is kept in the cloud.</p>
