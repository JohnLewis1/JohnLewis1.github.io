<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
