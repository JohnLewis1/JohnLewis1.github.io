<p>We enjoy that the Argus 2 comes with a color night vision choice, however the white and black variation can actually be clearer and give you higher-quality video footage. This isn't actually a huge deal thinking about the Argus 2's price and all its other features-- however for the record, stick to black and white. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo wise service. But the coolest feature is that you can charge it with the help of solar energy with a solar panel battery charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>

<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a total security package, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood should shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less burglaries across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to authorities ability to collar burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund police reaction to alarmed properties) a costly and inefficient  method to break-in reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
