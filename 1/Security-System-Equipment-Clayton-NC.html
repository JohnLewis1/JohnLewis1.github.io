<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
