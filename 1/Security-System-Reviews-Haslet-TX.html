<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
