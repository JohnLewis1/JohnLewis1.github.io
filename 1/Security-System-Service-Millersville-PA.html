Larger systems that use full-house coverage with expert monitoring are the most costly options. Smaller, self-monitored systems are the most economical option.</p>

Commercial cameras outperform their more affordable cousins due to the fact that they have larger internal video sensing units and higher-quality parts that can adapt and capture outstanding low light video.</p>
