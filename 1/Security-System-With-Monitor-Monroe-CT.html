<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the specific same way. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric present. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
