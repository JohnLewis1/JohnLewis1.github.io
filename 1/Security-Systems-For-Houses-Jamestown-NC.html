<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, covering numerous years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly evolved into the highly advanced yet affordable systems offered today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape video and view it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>Conspicuous and messy wires encountering walls and floorboards are an eyesore - no matter the scenario.

The app was also painfully slow when we accessed live streams and tape-recorded clips, as well as when we made changes in the settings.</p>
