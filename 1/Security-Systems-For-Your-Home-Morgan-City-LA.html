<p>Our alarm systems may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an infraction.

Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and switching off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
