Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I evaluated, consisting of creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. But the Secure is costly, additional sensors are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which does not include smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also costly if you don't devote to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is an enjoyment to utilize also (a lot better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a learning curve.
