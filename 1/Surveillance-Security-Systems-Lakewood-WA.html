<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our testing-- during the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based on readily available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day.
