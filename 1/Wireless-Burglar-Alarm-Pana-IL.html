If you bought cameras before 2010 or if you have coax cable television (look at the cable behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable box) in your existing security system that implies you have conventional analog CCTV security cameras. If you buy HD-CCTV security system, you can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without compromising your coax infrastructure.
