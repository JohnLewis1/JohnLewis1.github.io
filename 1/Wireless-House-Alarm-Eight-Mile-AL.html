<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter occasion notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts each time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
