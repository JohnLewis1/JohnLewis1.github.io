<p>3 big benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their impermanence, mobility and expandability. Renters, unlike property owners, usually prevent making permanent changes to their homes.

The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally focus and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>
