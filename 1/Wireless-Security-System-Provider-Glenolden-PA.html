Nevertheless, you will need to spend for extra $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) per month, and this does not included expert monitoring. This additional cost isn't ideal, however when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- respective minimum prices per month for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a take.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
