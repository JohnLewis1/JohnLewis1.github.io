<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader area and therefore offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
