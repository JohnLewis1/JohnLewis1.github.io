<p>Because it's more complex than it needs to be, we do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>There's a couple of other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving things if it spots an intruder; a helpful intercom function that allows the device to function as a clever doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hey there doorbell ); and, because Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.
