We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only informs you when motion is created by something with the same heat pattern as a human (guaranteeing there's no incorrect informs). Nevertheless, you do require to sign up for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get notifies on your phone if the sensing units have been activated.
