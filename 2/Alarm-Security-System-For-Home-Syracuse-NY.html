Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
