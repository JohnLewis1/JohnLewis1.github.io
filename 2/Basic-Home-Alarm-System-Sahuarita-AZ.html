<p>No incorrect alarm charges: House owners with a self-monitored system are less most likely to dispatch the authorities for a false alarm. Considering that the homeowner supervises of the system, authorities are only called if there's a real emergency situation. On the other hand, an expert monitoring company will call police if a house owner can't validate an incorrect alarm. , if authorities are contacted for a false alarm, property owners may need to pay a fine for dispatching cops unnecessarily.
