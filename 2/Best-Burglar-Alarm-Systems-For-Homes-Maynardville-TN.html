<p>Twenty-five years earlier, general and business interactions were primarily synchronous. To achieve practically anything, someone live" needed to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, particularly when handling national and worldwide business.

Whatever is synchronized and whatever takes place in real time.</p>
<p>Most modern CCTV video surveillance systems include DVRs (digital video recorders) which make it possible for operators to enjoy some of the advantages of a network-based surveillance setup.

If intruders can not see any security cameras, they might also be less mindful about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>
