<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
