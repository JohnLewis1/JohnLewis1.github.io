A Web protocol camera is a digital camera that sends and receives information by means of a computer network. This differs from a CCTV camera, which can only send and receive signals through a cable television linked to a DVR.</p>
<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, due to the fact that it is rather connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.

You can even pair several cameras together on the app, if you so dream. Keep in mind that Nest cameras aren't professionally monitored-- that part's on you. (The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.)
