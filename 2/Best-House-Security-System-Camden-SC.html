Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a particular area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance supplied by CCTV will minimize criminal activity and boost arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other neighboring locations where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

The cameras will be monitored by the Jefferson County City Area Crime Center The license plate recognition camera information will be uploaded to the FBI's Crook Justice Details Services, and the city will acquire the content from the FBI's website. Although a proposed ordinance requiring all facilities with liquor licenses to install cameras that feed into the monitoring center was deserted in the face of opposition, several bars accused of breaching liquor laws have actually gotten in authorization decrees with the city's Liquor Control board, requiring them to do just that.</p>
<p>Hybrid systems utilize both wired and wireless sensing units to achieve the benefits of both. Transmitters can also be linked through the facilities' electrical circuits to transfer coded signals to the control unit (line carrier). The control unit generally has a different channel or zone for burglar and fire sensing units, and much better systems have a separate zone for each various sensor, as well as internal problem signs (mains power loss, low battery, damaged wire, and so on).</p>
