<p>We don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complex than it should be. Recordings, notifies, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
