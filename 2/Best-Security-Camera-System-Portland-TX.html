<p>The real reason cameras are typically deployed is to reduce much pettier criminal offenses. But it has not even been demonstrated that they can do that.

"Once the criminal activity and offence figures were adapted to take account of the basic downward trend in criminal activities and offenses," criminologists discovered in one study, "decreases were kept in mind in certain classifications however there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had minimized criminal offense in general in the city centre."
