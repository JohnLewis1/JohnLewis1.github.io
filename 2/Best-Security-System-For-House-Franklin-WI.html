<p>Blink cameras are compact, consist of free storage, and utilize two AA batteries that can last up to two years. Nevertheless, to save that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next.

So much, in fact, that they need about four times the hard drive area of 1080p to tape the exact same length of video footage.
