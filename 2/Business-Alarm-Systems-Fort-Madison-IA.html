<p>Discover how to design, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and decrease criminal activity. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be touchy, with terrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our system was defective, and so we might revisit this evaluation. Basically, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of video to the cloud. The broad face of the camera provides you an outstanding visual field, and the image you get is of good quality (you can alter the resolution; the better it gets, the more information you'll utilize to save it to the cloud.)
