<p>Discover how to design, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and decrease criminal activity. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be touchy, with terrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our system was defective, and so we might revisit this evaluation. Basically, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of video to the cloud.
