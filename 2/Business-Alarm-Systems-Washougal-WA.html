<p>When looking at a normal camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the distinction between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to deal with information after the truth, which means that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are huge and take up a great deal of tape-recording storage area. A lot, in reality, that they need about 4 times the hard drive area of 1080p to record the same length of video footage. Be prepared to invest more cash if extended video storage is necessary.</p>
<p>Many home security systems are controlled by smart devices which trend will continue. Systems will have less wall-mounted keypads, and instead, offer more controls to more gadgets. Wireless door, window, glass break, water, motion and freeze sensors interact with a hub or base station in your home. The primary control must be centrally situated in your home and have full-time non-switched A/C power. Wired alarm systems are extremely dependable and you don't need to fret about their battery running out. However, they are fixed in place, may require professional installation, and they're not portable.</p>
