With decades of experience monitoring and installing video and audio security systems for Seattle homes and organisations, we've constructed great relationships with both local police and their consumers. Also, do not forget that your wireless network security can be sometimes weak, and prone to exploits. It almost doesn't matter how strong your password is or if your software is up to date if cybercriminals can just pirate your Wi-Fi data.

<p>Outdoor Camera - This weatherproof camera provides smooth security video with a combination of hard electrical wiring and WiFi. It's motion-activated and has a speaker system, letting you send out voice cautions through your phone. The lens covers 140 degrees and lets you zoom in on the action. Like the Ping camera, the Vivint Outdoor Camera records 20-second clips. After we used the Anker EufyCam for nearly six months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to deliver on its guarantee of up to one year of battery life.

Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic sound wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi info. (You must play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pet dogs howl, cats shriek, babies weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first ten seconds. It doesn't work. And it never ever works.</p>
