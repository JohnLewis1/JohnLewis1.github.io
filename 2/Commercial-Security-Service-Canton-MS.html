<p>Somewhat more pricey than our winning smart alarm, this system was nearly as basic to install and, during screening, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if one of the sensors had been triggered.

Although the cameras evaluated in this guide do have basic security features, they can't change a full home security system, which includes door and window and motion sensors, smoke detectors, and so on.</p>
