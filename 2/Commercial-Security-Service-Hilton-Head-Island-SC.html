<p>Discover how to develop, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and minimize crime. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is costly, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with terrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was defective, and so we may review this review. Basically, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last five days of video to the cloud. The broad face of the camera provides you an excellent visual field, and the image you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.) To see that video footage, you can use an app on your phone or a browser link on your computer.</p>

The potential value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the method back in April, 2013 when detectives determined the 2 suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sifting through video images recorded by the city's cameras.</p>
