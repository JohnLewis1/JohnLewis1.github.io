<p>You would be hard-pressed to tell the difference between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a normal camera image. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve detail after the truth, which means that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are very large and take up a great deal of recording storage space. A lot, in fact, that they need about four times the hard drive space of 1080p to tape the exact same length of video footage. If extended video storage is crucial, be prepared to invest more cash.</p>
<p>Some monitoring costs in our table do not include things like mobile access, home automation, or camera monitoring. You might need to pay more for those features. Vivint, Ring, Residence, Brinks, and Nest stick out here-- they give you mobile monitoring with any plan. With other companies, we think mobile access is worth the additional cost so you can sign in at any time and control your system from anywhere.
