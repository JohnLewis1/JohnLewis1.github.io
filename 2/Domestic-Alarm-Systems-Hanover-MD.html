<p>Network cameras can be utilized for really cheap surveillance options (requiring one network camera, some Ethernet cabling, and one PC), or to replace entire CCTV setups (cameras become network cameras, tape recorders become DVRs, and CCTV monitors become computer systems with TFT screens and specialised software application.
