In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations.

As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers realize that the economical customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
