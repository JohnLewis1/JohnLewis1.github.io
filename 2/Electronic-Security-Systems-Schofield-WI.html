<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
