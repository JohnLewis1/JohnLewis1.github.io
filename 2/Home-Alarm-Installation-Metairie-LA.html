<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
