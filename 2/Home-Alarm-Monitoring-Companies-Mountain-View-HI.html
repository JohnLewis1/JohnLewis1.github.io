Sadly I purchased 4 cameras that look similar to these, believing I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Young boy was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of the box. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is truly fantastic. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
