<p>Three big advantages of wireless security systems for tenants are their expandability, impermanence and mobility. Renters, unlike house owners, typically avoid making permanent modifications to their homes.

On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entryways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensing units and other parts can quickly be set up at various residential or commercial properties later, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new components too. Wireless security strategies also permit remote control of the system and general home automation.
