<p>A wired security system was the first kind of security system that was invented for homeowners. It needs to be set up by an expert alarm installation team and, once set up, is tough to move from one location to another. Wired systems are more common for large homes and are typically more costly than a wireless home security system. They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera just like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the group will need to remodel the existing wires in your home. The group will be able to recycle the existing circuitry if you have actually already set up a wired system in the past and you are updating to a new system.
