<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers realize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
