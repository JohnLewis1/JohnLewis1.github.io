<p>So, while alarm systems might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood ought to take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer burglaries throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. However, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute considerably to police capability to nab robbers makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers support cops response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a pricey and ineffective  method to theft decrease across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
