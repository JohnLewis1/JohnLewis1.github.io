The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses seven days of totally free cloud storage (with more available for a regular monthly charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to effectively identify motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That also saves battery life, but it may leave you with tape-recording gaps during essential security events.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
