<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or house is the responsibility of the whole neighborhood. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The response depends upon a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you intend to store and the length of time you plan to keep documented video footage.
