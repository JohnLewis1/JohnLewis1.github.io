<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
