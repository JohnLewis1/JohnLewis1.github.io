As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical since the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
