<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function.

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
