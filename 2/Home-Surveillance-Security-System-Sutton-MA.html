Ring recommends this package for homes with up to 2 bed rooms and around 2,000 square feet. We have actually also attempted to limit this list to cameras that can dish out signals that are reliable and really useful - if your camera is pinging your phone whenever a leaf blows past, you're quickly going to get tired of needing to inspect it.</p>
