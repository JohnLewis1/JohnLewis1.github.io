<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search innovation that is quickly altering the security industry, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so essential?  For beginners, Deep Knowing allows somebody to discover what they are trying to find without needing to explore hours of useless video footage.  Picture a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the elements you are trying to find in the tape-recorded video footage.  For instance, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we merely type authorities" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a police car appears.

With some, it's tough to inform at a look where they've been aimed, so they can offer a panoptic impression as a deterrent, no matter their real field of view.

With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
