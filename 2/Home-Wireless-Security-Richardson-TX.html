<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular since the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
