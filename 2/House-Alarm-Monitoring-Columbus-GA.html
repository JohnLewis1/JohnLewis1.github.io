The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
