When citizens are being viewed by the authorities - or mindful they might be seen at any time - they are more uncomfortable and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being enjoyed by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You don't wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he alerts, "people may discover to be cautious about the books and regulars they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm hidden observers. They might also put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, members or drug addicts."
