Outdoor cameras need to be weather condition resistant and sometimes, totally waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance score are the most long lasting. Since their design permits for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor alternatives.

To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even determine individuals you've identified (after a knowing period).
