<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise nice metal building.

Should be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
