As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical since the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
