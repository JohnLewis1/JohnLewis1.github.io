If you go on trip and have somebody coming by to inspect or feed family pets on your home, set a temporary password and reset it as soon as you return. As newer security systems shift to cloud-based, wireless platforms, it is important to guard yourself against network intrusion just as you would with protecting your identity and virtual properties online.</p>
