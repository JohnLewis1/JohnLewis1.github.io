<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for among our top spots. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of up to 25 seconds in between recordings.
