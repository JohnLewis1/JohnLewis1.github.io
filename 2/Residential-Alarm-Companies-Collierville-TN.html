<p>Pelco provides video surveillance cameras and video management services for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping centers, others, and hotels. Some people may say that we must not have surveillance cameras in public places. They declare that they invade privacy. The argument here, however, is why be out in public if you want personal privacy? Surveillance cameras are meant to keep you and other property safe, not to stalk you. Cameras exist not to attack an individual's privacy but to protect the public by deterring criminal activity and by offering product evidence when a criminal offense has been caught on film.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years ago, general and business communications were mainly concurrent. To achieve practically anything, somebody live" required to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, specifically when dealing with international and national business. The same is true for security and video surveillance. Typically, CCTV is most efficient as an active system, with a security guard monitoring the corridors and someone else, somewhere, seeing video surveillance screens for support. Whatever is synchronized and whatever happens in real time.</p>
<p>Our alarm systems might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an infraction. Once a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. As soon as the signal is received, the intruder alarm will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
