"Once the criminal activity and offense figures were adjusted to take account of the general down trend in criminal activities and offenses," criminologists discovered in one study, "reductions were kept in mind in specific classifications but there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had reduced crime overall in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Home Office likewise found that cameras did not cut crime or the fear of crime (as had a 2002 research study, likewise for the British government).</p>
