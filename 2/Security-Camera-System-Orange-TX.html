<p>We needed guards for our annual Coats for the Cold event to protect the line tent and building, keep order in the wee hours of the morning and to start the heating system at 5am. The very first guard showed up early so he might look at the entire location and speak with me about my concerns. He was expert, extremely comforting and polite. The second guard got here in the middle of the night and took over. When I got here in the morning to get the occasion started, he was likewise expert, courteous and comforting. We were extremely happy with your service and I will suggest that we call on your company next year for this event. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. I didn't fret once after leaving our home in your hands.</p>
