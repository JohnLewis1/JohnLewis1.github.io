<p>B. This chapter governs alarm system systems meant to summon authorities department workers, requires registration, assessment of costs for excessive incorrect burglar alarms, offers treatments for repeat culprits, and offers an effective date. Whether you're using a wireless IP-based system or subscribe to a security part as a part of a "smart home" plan; these innovations depend on user passwords to arm and deactivate them.
