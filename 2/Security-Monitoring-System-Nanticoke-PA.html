<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically referred to as shock sensors, are various because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Normally, the most intense frequencies created are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
