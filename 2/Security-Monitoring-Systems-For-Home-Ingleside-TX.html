<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs every time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
