The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a great daytime image.

Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
