When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits, which means. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved.

Typically, the simple presence of security cameras can scare away less-motivated burglars. However keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or damaged by the more determined robbers. If intruders can not see any security cameras, they might also be less cautious about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>
