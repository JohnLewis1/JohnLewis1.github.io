<p>On the surface area, these 2 camera categories might appear similar, though if you had the ability to see inside, the distinctions end up being obvious and unique. Commercial-grade cameras are created and developed for high-performance applications where failure is not a choice; consumer-grade cameras are not. Usually, consumer-grade cameras are built to work well when there is plenty of available light, and when the lighting becomes low or missing (think sundown or nighttime), their pedigree begins to reveal. Commercial cameras outshine their less expensive cousins due to the fact that they have bigger internal video sensing units and higher-quality parts that can adjust and catch exceptional low light video.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers recognize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
