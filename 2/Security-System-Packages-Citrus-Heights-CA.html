<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we have actually tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even identify people you've identified (after a learning period). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were remarkable in our testing-- during the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We need to keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based on offered bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest includes the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>The Nest Web cam IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the same subscription model and exact same app as the initial Nest Cam Outdoor, but it adds in more-detailed individual detection, a brighter image, an automated close-up tracking function (which follows an individual around the seeing location), much better audio, a more powerful install, and a wider operating temperature level range (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit).
