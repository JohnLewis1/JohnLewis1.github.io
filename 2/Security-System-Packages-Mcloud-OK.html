<p>Thanks to current developments in technology, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you've made the decision to install a burglar alarm, you must think about the following benefits of wireless technology. For some, that may be worth the $300 cost. However while we like the smart functions and home automation compatibility of the Nest Webcam IQ, a number of the cameras we looked at offer the same advantages at a more affordable cost. Handle your home no matter where you are with the Vivint Smart Home app. Use your mobile phone to speak and see with visitors at your door, see and safeguard packages, track activity with kept video, or connect with family at home. With security camera control in the palm of your hand, assurance is yours.</p>
