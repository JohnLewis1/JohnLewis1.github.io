<p>There are two primary types of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: internet procedure (IP) cameras and the standard analog cameras. IP cameras are the more contemporary iteration of analog cameras, and while the private cameras tend to be a little more costly, they use a variety of features that analog cameras do not. Here's a take a look at the distinctions between the 2 kinds of camera. Today's wireless home security systems are more steady than they used to be.
