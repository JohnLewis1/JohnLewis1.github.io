<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is saved on a remote server run by the producer, rather of at your house) is the norm these days, but some cameras store recordings locally on a microSD card or a connected hard drive. Onboard storage is nice, but it will not be of much help if somebody takes the camera. Hackers can gain control of wireless camera systems.

<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security plan, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community need to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less burglaries throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute considerably to police ability to nab robbers makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers subsidize police action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a ineffective and costly approach to burglary decrease across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
