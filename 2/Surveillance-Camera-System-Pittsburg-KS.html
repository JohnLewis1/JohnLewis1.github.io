<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel published a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. When it found any type of interference, SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration stating the system would notify users. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a perfect storm of situations for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using 2 various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to duplicate the issue. Although our testing shouldn't be taken as definitive, we believe this concern is not likely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe customers who own the current system.</p>
<p>We like the 10-piece Alarm Security Kit because it includes all the basics (base station, keypad, motion sensor) plus a couple of extra entry sensing units.

We've also tried to restrict this list to cameras that can provide signals that are actually useful and trusted - if your camera is pinging your phone every time a leaf blows past, you're soon going to get fed up with having to inspect it.</p>
