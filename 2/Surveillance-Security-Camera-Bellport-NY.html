The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a terrific daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensor to be touchy, with dreadful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our unit was faulty, therefore we may review this review. Basically, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last five days of video to the cloud.
