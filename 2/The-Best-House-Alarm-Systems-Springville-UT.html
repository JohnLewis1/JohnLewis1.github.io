<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
