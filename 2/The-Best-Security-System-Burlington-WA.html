The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
