<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal considering that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
