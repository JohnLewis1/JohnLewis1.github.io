What you usually discover at stores are consumer-grade cameras, which typically come 8 or 16 cameras bundled with a video recorder and sell for less than a thousand dollars (United States $) for the set. The second category of camera, commercial-grade cameras, generally starts at about $400 (US) per camera-- a considerably greater price.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
