<p>GO2 offers full-service Video Surveillance Installation of hd (HD), IP, digital, outdoor, and wireless Security Camera Systems. Of course, the apparent drawback to a wired security system is that the initial install can be costly. If the system was not set up during the homebuilding procedure, setting one up might require drilling holes into walls, running new wires, patching drywall and getting to tough spots that are sealed off in basements or attics. Wired security systems are also susceptible to power failures. Many will have a backup battery system that turns on in case of a failure, however long term interruptions will result in the system losing power. It's likewise crucial to think about how long you prepare to stay at the very same residence when picking a wired system.

<p>There's no devoted hub involved here - each camera connects straight to your router through Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there. That's a neat solution, or at least one that conserves a power socket and an Ethernet port, however we can't help but feel it's also the factor for the Swann's slightly slow reaction times.

If the camera is battery powered you can put it pretty much anywhere without any wires, recharging the battery and eliminating when it runs low, which is usually triggered through its app. Clearly the benefit is that these can be positioned anywhere extremely easily, however the drawback is that if it's easy for you to remove the camera to alter the battery, it'll most likely be simple for intruders to eliminate it too.</p>
