<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
