<p>3 huge advantages of wireless security systems for occupants are their mobility, expandability and impermanence. Occupants, unlike property owners, typically prevent making permanent modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they include drilling into walls and setting up permanent electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entryways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other components can quickly be established at various properties later on, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new parts too. Wireless security plans also allow remote control of the system and general home automation.
