<p>A system that needs an agreement may be a clever option for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems normally do not come with in advance fees. Rather, the expenses are spread out over the length of the agreement.

Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
