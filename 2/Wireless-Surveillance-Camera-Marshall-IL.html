<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
